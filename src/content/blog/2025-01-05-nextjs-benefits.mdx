# Why Next.js is Perfect for Content-Driven Websites

Next.js has become the go-to framework for building modern web applications, especially content-driven websites. Here's why.

## Server-Side Rendering (SSR)

Next.js provides built-in SSR, which means:
- **Better SEO**: Search engines can easily crawl your content
- **Faster initial load**: Content is rendered on the server
- **Improved performance**: Users see content immediately

## Static Site Generation (SSG)

For content that doesn't change frequently:

```javascript
export async function generateStaticParams() {
  const posts = await getPosts();
  return posts.map((post) => ({ slug: post.slug }));
}
```

This pre-renders pages at build time for lightning-fast delivery.

## Image Optimization

The Next.js Image component automatically:
- Optimizes images for different screen sizes
- Lazy loads images
- Serves modern formats like WebP
- Prevents layout shift

## File-Based Routing

Creating new pages is as simple as adding a file:

```
app/
  blog/
    page.tsx        → /blog
    [slug]/
      page.tsx      → /blog/post-name
```

## Built-in Performance

Next.js optimizes your site automatically:
- Code splitting
- Prefetching
- Compression
- Caching

## Conclusion

For content-driven websites, Next.js offers the perfect combination of performance, SEO, and developer experience.
